Playing with the kinect and processing 

for a class, really works best wtih processing 6 and the first gen kinect

the colors are set to random. i used it for a play test involving interaction and users. essentially, i was testing to see if the users could figure out if the device was set to random (tested with four people, no one mentioned that) and how they would respond to the colors changing in the squares on the screen. 
each user assigned meanings to the colors; the users thought their movements would make particular colors appear, not realizing that the colors were random and that only their movements caused random colors to occur- not specific colors. 

note- to use, you need to adjust the levels. the bottom level can never be less than the top, otherwise the kinect will not read your movement.
actually, that's a huge note. i should probably bold that.


nah. 

anyway, watch your levels, kids!
